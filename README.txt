Contributions of each partner (if working with a partner)
    --> Every Algorithm was implemented by Curtis

How to compile and run your program
    --> DO NOT CLICK THE PLAY BUTTON WHEN USING YOUR FAVORITE EDITOR
    --> Download 'kokul003_Project4.zip' file and decompress it
    --> Use the TERMINAL
    --> Go to directory with all the files
    --> WARNING: Make sure you are in the right directory/module that contain all the classes
    --> To Run HashTable.java
        --> Type 'javac HashTable.java' to compile and then 'java HashTable' to run

Any assumptions
    --> Assume that all the algorithms in every class are implemented using examples from lectures,
        own knowledge and/or other resources

Additional features that you implemented (if applicable)
    --> printInformation()  - helper method used in display() to print out the required information about the table
    --> getType() - helper method that uses Scanner to get the type of the hash table from the user
    --> getSize() - helper method that gets size the type of the hash table that is prime
    --> getRandomPrime() - helper method that gets a random prime number in the range
    --> isPrime() - helper method that returns a boolean depending on num

Any known bugs or defects in the program
    --> You can assume that there is no bugs or failures in the program.

Any outside sources
    --> No outside sources

Include the statement:
    --> I certify that the information contained in this README
        file is complete and accurate. I have both read and followed the course policies
